# K-Go Quests

An offline learning app for Philippine public-school learners. It runs on a shared
Android tablet and adapts practice to each learner. Learners never need a network;
the Caretaker goes online once, at Setup.

## Language

### People and devices

**Learner**:
A child who practises on the tablet.
_Avoid_: student, user, account

**Caretaker**:
The adult who manages a Shared Tablet. Only the Caretaker can create or delete Profiles, reset a Learner's PIN and see Plateau Flags for every Profile. The Caretaker signs in to a Caretaker Account once at Setup, then uses a Caretaker PIN offline.
_Avoid_: teacher, admin, parent

**Caretaker Account**:
The Caretaker's online identity. It is used at Setup and to reset a forgotten Caretaker PIN, and both need the tablet to be online. Only the Caretaker Account that did Setup can reset the Caretaker PIN. Learners never have one.
_Avoid_: login, user account

**Setup**:
The first launch of the app on a Shared Tablet. The Caretaker signs in to their Caretaker Account, sets the Caretaker PIN and creates the first Profiles.
_Avoid_: onboarding, registration

**Profile**:
One Learner's identity and progress on one Shared Tablet, protected by a PIN. It is shown by an alias the Caretaker picks, never a legal name.
_Avoid_: account, login

**Shared Tablet**:
One device used in turn by several Learners, each through their own Profile. A Learner always uses the same Shared Tablet.
_Avoid_: device, phone

### Content

**Pack Author**:
The person who writes Content Packs, outside the app.
_Avoid_: admin, teacher, content manager

**Content Pack**:
A bundle of Lessons for one Subject, with each Skill's parameters.
_Avoid_: course, module, download

**Starter Pack**:
A Content Pack that ships inside the app, so the app works on first launch.

**Subject**:
One school subject, such as Math or Science. Each Content Pack covers one Subject.

**Skill**:
One competency that has its own Mastery.
_Avoid_: topic, competency code

**Lesson**:
A short reading on one Skill, followed by Exercises.

**Exercise**:
One multiple-choice question with exactly one correct option.
_Avoid_: item, question, quiz

**Hint**:
A fixed explanation written by the Pack Author, in one or more languages. The app reads a Hint aloud only when the tablet has a voice for that language. A Hint is never generated at practice time.
_Avoid_: tutor, AI tutor

### Practice

**Attempt**:
A Learner's answer to one Exercise. The tablet grades it at once.
_Avoid_: submission, sync event

**Counted Attempt**:
The first Attempt a Learner makes at an Exercise. Only Counted Attempts move Mastery and earn Coins; later Attempts are practice only.
_Avoid_: retry, score

### Learning model

**Mastery**:
The estimated probability that a Learner knows a Skill, updated after each Counted Attempt.
_Avoid_: score, level, progress

**Mastered**:
A Skill whose Mastery is at least 0.95.
_Avoid_: complete, passed, done

**Skill Parameters**:
The four numbers (prior, learn, guess, slip) that control how Mastery moves for one Skill. They are fitted offline and shipped in a Content Pack.
_Avoid_: model, weights

**Default Skill Parameters**:
Placeholder Skill Parameters used for every Skill until fitted values exist. They are a starting guess, not a measurement.
_Avoid_: dummy data, real model

**Quest**:
A practice suggestion: one Exercise the Learner has not answered yet, taken from the lowest-Mastery Skill that is not Mastered.
_Avoid_: task, assignment

**Plateau Flag**:
A mark on a Skill where a Learner has made at least five Counted Attempts and Mastery is still below 0.40. The Learner sees it as a nudge to review; the Caretaker sees it for every Profile.
_Avoid_: alert, failing, at-risk

### Motivation

**Coin**:
A point earned for a correct Counted Attempt. A Coin has no value outside the app and buys only Cosmetics.
_Avoid_: Khan-Coin, money, reward

**Cosmetic**:
A badge built into the app that a Learner buys with Coins. A Cosmetic never changes what or how a Learner practises.

**Growth**:
Two counts for one month: the Learner's Skills whose Mastery went up, and the Skills that became Mastered. Each count is shown next to last month's. Growth compares a Learner only with their own past, never with other Learners, and it is never negative.
_Avoid_: league, rank, leaderboard, score

## Relationships

- A **Shared Tablet** holds one or more **Profiles**, managed by one **Caretaker**
- A **Caretaker** has one **Caretaker Account**; a **Learner** has none
- A **Profile** belongs to exactly one **Learner**, and a **Learner** has exactly one **Profile**
- A **Content Pack** covers one **Subject** and contains many **Lessons**
- A **Lesson** practises one **Skill**, contains many **Exercises** and has one **Hint**
- A **Skill** belongs to exactly one **Content Pack** and has one set of **Skill Parameters**
- A **Profile** has one **Mastery** value for each **Skill** it has practised
- A **Quest** points to one **Exercise**
- A **Plateau Flag** belongs to one **Profile** and one **Skill**
- A **Profile** earns **Coins** and owns the **Cosmetics** it bought

## Flagged ambiguities

- "AI" meant both the Mastery estimate and a conversational tutor. Resolved: the only on-device model is Mastery. The tutor screen becomes **Hints**.
- "Student" and "learner" were used interchangeably. Resolved: **Learner**.
- "Reward" meant both Coins and vouchers for real goods. Resolved: only **Coins** exist, and they buy **Cosmetics**. Vouchers are gone.
- "League" meant ranking classrooms against each other. Resolved: replaced by **Growth**, which compares a Learner only with themselves.
- "Teacher" and "admin" meant separate accounts. Resolved: one **Caretaker** per **Shared Tablet**.
- "Dummy data for the AI" resolved to **Default Skill Parameters** plus demo Lessons in the **Starter Pack**.
- "Provisional" correctness and Coins: resolved. Every **Attempt** is graded at once on the tablet, so nothing is provisional.
- "Quest" was first written here as pointing to a Skill; the code makes it one Exercise. Resolved: one **Exercise**.
- **Hint**: the spec wanted one Hint per Exercise; the code holds one Hint per Lesson. Resolved: one Hint per **Lesson**.
- "Khan-on-the-Go" and "Khan-Coin" suggested a link with Khan Academy. Resolved: the app is **K-Go Quests**, and its points are **Coins**.
- "Authentication" could mean Learners or the Caretaker signing in online. Resolved: only the **Caretaker** has a **Caretaker Account**; Learners use Profile PINs and never go online.
- How a Caretaker recovers a forgotten Caretaker PIN. Resolved: by signing in again to the same **Caretaker Account**.
